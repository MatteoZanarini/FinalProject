# Final Project - Business Analytics 

## Description
A fictional company, that sells bicycles in multiple countries, decided to optimize its marketing strategies and increase revenue through a data science analysis. 


This project aims to provide data-driven insights through the analysis of the dataset provided by the firm. This datset includes product-level information about sales, profits, market segments, and geographic distribution.

The main goals are to examine sales trends over time, compare sales across different regions, identify top-selling products and analyze the relationship between discounts and sales or profits using a scatter plot or linear regression model.

## Methodology
The approach for this analysis includes:
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key trends and patterns
- Data Visualization: Using charts and plots to summarize findings
- Statistical Analysis & Modeling: Applying regression and correlation analyses to uncover insights
